#### about

I work on quantum computing software and am a graduate student at Purdue University. I'm also [building hardware](https://gigabug.org) and doing some start-up work on the side. I currently live in Cambridge, MA. See my [resume](/about/matt-bowring-resume.pdf) for more.

Some other interests include: cycling, hiking, lifting, climbing, music, cooking, reading, fashion, design, videography. I try to blog now and then.
