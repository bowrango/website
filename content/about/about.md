#### about

Welcome to my website. I work as quantum software engineer and am a graduate student. I write about some of my research [here](https://gigabug.org). My life questions come from the common space of physics, computing, numerics, markets, biology, and people. I'll occasionally write about these interests to document my quest of understanding them. I live in Cambridge, MA.

I also enjoy: cycling, lifting, hiking, climbing, running, skiing, riflery, flying, and music.
