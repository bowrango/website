#### about

Welcome to my website! I'm a quantum software engineer and graduate student. I'm broadly curious about physics, computer systems, numerical methods, financial markets, biology, and people. Specifically, I'm interested in applying physics-inspired optimization to the hardware/software co-design of low-power ML/AI accelerators. Some current work can be seen [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23720). I live in Cambridge, MA. 

I also enjoy: cycling, lifting, hiking, climbing, running, skiing, riflery, flying, and music.

Please feel free to contact me via email: mbowring at purdue dot edu. I love meeting new people.
