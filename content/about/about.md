#### about

Welcome to my website! I'm a quantum software engineer and graduate student. I'm broadly curious about physics, computer systems, numerical methods, financial markets, biology, and people. I'm broadly interested in the physics-based computing framework for hardware/software co-design of AI accelerators. Some of my current work can be seen [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23720) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/bowrango).

I also enjoy: cycling, lifting, hiking, climbing, running, skiing, riflery, flying, and music.

I live in Cambridge, MA and can be reached thru email: mbowring at purdue dot edu.
