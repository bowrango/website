#### about

I work on quantum computing software and study mech/ee at Purdue. I'm also [researching hardware](https://gigabug.org) and doing start-up work on the side. I currently live in Cambridge, MA.

Some interests include: cycling, hiking, lifting, climbing, music, cooking, reading, writing, geopolitics, neuroscience, markets/finance, fashion, design, videography.

I built this website using Hugo and try to blog now and then.
