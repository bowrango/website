#### about

I'm a graduate student at Purdue and work on quantum computing software. I'm also [researching hardware](https://gigabug.org) and doing some start-up work on the side. I currently live in Cambridge, MA.

Some other interests include: cycling, hiking, lifting, climbing, music, cooking, reading, writing, geopolitics, markets, fashion, design, videography. I try to blog now and then.

This website is developed using Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare. I'm looking to contract design work.
