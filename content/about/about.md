#### about

Welcome to my website! I'm a quantum software engineer and graduate student. I'm curious about physics, computing, numerics, markets, biology, and people. My current research interest can be seen [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23720). I live in Cambridge, MA. 

I also enjoy: cycling, lifting, hiking, climbing, running, skiing, riflery, flying, and music.
