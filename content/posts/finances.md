This is not financial advice just my advice on finances. You just want index funds, probably. Best way to hedge yourself against inflation but still have fun.

It's good to diversify, and trading individal stocks is higher risk and reward, just remember you're priced out. Holding individual stocks shouldn't be the bulk of your portfolio. Options are tougher since you're betting on specific prices and dates instead of general trends. Others have more information than you do.

currency inflation -> "economic entropy" as a byproudct of transactions, analgous to work. Less buying power relates to less capacity to do work. Efficient systems are slow and steady.

Think about the services and products you use. Other people use them too. Last time in NYC I got lunch at Cava. I don't know any other Mediterranean chains and it has a similar business model to Chiptole, which also has been on the rise. Something is clearly working because Cava is up ~250% since a year ago. Well, to be fair it only IPO'ed back in June 2023 but my point stands. It was a simple vibes bet that paid off. I've never owned a restaurant.  

SPAXX pays around 5% returns per year. Set and forget!
