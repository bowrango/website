My research for [Gigabug Computer](https://gigabug.org) got a finalist spot in a start-up competition. I pitched to Google, Microsoft, JP Morgan, and others in Boston Seaport. Techstars, Cambridge Innovation Center, and C10 Labs helped organize the event.

Steve Wozniak gave an opening talk on thinking differently, and how engineering, marketing and sales are all equally important. He reflected on the early days of Apple, where he just wanted to build computers for fun.

My work stems from a curiosity in physics and engineering to explore alternative computing. Sometimes this narrative doesn't feel as captivating as the "personal problem X that lead me to build solution Y". That is more compelling because humans are storytellers. The history of physics-based computing is also an interesting story, albeit harder to convince non-technicals of the value. I'm always learning.

I walked around the stage beforehand to get more comfortable. I had a 2-minute pitch followed by a few minutes of questions from the judges. I'll add some images once I track down the recording. I'm happy with the delivery, but needed to focus more on the marketing and business aspects. My non-technical presentation may have been too technical.

The [winner](https://www.neoclease.ai) and [runner-up](https://xtory.ai) were biotech/medical start-ups, and much further along. All the founders were great to connect with and very nice.

There was a follow-up investor dinner in downtown Boston several weeks later. I initially got off at the wrong floor and thought everyone went home. But I ended up being among the last few people to stay, and we all got drinks. We talked about: being a Swiss Army knife; why Apple lies about privacy while Meta doesnâ€™t; trusting Anduril more than Palantir; being long AMD; whether NVIDIA can grow much more; distinctions between hard and deep tech; taking risks; cycling and running; and why chance is really a choice. My favorite conversations happen at the afterparty. The food was good too.
