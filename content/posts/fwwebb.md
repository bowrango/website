I started CAD before programming. Highschool lunches were spent in the computer lab.

Freelance design for fiber optic layouts of an F.W. Webb warehouse. 

That led to a summer gig designing HVAC layouts for residential and commerical. I got caught playing the balloons tower defense stratedy game and got banished to the warehouse for a couple days. It was fun painting the office, though. Once I stacked up extra cardboard and took a nap underneath the staircase.
