The following is my microgrant application from the Unitary Fund. It outlines a business plan for developing the Ising computer.

Shippable testbed for developing Ising machine algorithms. 

Develop electronic oscillator to study probabilistic bits 

- promising applications in optimization using low energy
- No open source oscillator hardware design (?); Berkeley MAPP isn’t active 
- Algorithm testbed for energy-based models (Ising machine, Boltzmann); Makes “quantum”/thermodynamic hardware accesible 
- Current startups don’t have open access
- During my career developing quantum computing library for matlab, I’ve seen firsthand difficulties in custom applications. I’m curious to explore adjacent tech
